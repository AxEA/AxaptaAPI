# AxaptaAPI
Dynamics AX 2012 RESTful API

### The Project
AxaptaAPI project was created to expose AX 2012 services as RESTul web-services, making it easily consumed by any client/platform and easily extended. This is a totally functional light version of the framework. The main project is still under development.

### Compatibility
The API was created to be used with AX 2012 (any release). No version for AX7 will be done, since it already works using REST/OData services. A portability to AX 2009 is technically possible but out of the scope of this project.

### Documentation
